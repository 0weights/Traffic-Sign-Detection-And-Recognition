# Traffic Sign Detection and Recognition

This repository contains code for detecting and recognizing traffic signs in images and video streams. It uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to identify and classify various traffic signs, such as stop signs, yield signs, and speed limit signs.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or later
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Numpy

## Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/0weights/Traffic-Sign-Detection-And-Recognition.git`

To detect and recognize traffic signs in an image:
python detect_and_recognize.py --image path/to/image.jpg

To detect and recognize traffic signs in a video stream:

python detect_and_recognize_video.py --video path/to/video.mp4

## Models
The repository includes a pre-trained TensorFlow model for recognizing traffic signs. However, you can also train your own model using the training data provided in the data directory.
